description         Camlp5 is a preprocessor-pretty-printer of OCaml.
long_description    Camlp5 is a preprocessor and pretty-printer for \
                    OCaml programs. It also provides parsing and \
                    printing tools. As a preprocessor, it allows to: \
                    extend the syntax of OCaml, redefine the whole \
                    syntax of the language. As a pretty printer, it \
                    allows to: display OCaml programs in an elegant \
                    way, convert from one syntax to another, check the \
                    results of syntax extensions. Camlp5 also provides \
                    some parsing and pretty printing tools: extensible \
                    grammars, extensible printers, stream parsers and \
                    lexers pretty print module.  It works as a shell \
                    command and can also be used in the OCaml toplevel.
